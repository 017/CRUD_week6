# CRUD_week6
Welcome to the full CRUD application collaborated on by Robert Ochi and Harrison Fairbairn.
This application is rather simple. It uses an empty array to start for our database.
In this build you will find usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery, and Ajax. 
As well as a little assistance from PouchDB.
The idea with this app is to Create, Read, Update, and Delete our inputs from the database.
The input Class we have gone with is Customers. Taking multiple arguments such as,
Name, Phone number, Email address, Home address. Once created the customer information
is stored in the array and visible on the screen. Of course, if this was an actual system for
actual customers, we would not be displaying peoples personal information for all to see.
